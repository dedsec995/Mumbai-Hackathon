- Student = This section is for student and is a Mixed Reality section. where user just has to wear a VR Box and the user will be provided with 3D model of the Human body, skeleton, internal organs and etc. This will help students to understand the subject Easily.
- Doctors = This section is AR + IoT section. where people dont need to go to dotors for basic checkups. They just need to wear our glove which consists of heartrate sensor, room temperature sensor, body temprature sensor and humidity sensor. User have to wear and scan the target using our app. and they will be provided with all the data of their body along with 3D object of their organs which are been scanned.

Our application is made using Unity3D, Vuforia and cloud to store data Online and or hardware side we used Raspberry Pie for hosting server, NodeMCU for all the sensors and arduino ide for uploading the code.
Language of code = C#, python, C.
